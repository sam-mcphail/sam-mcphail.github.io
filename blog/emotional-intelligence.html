        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence, otherwise quantified by Emotional Intelligence
          Quotient or EQ is defined by someone’s ability to control their
          emotions in order to communicate effectively with themself and others.
          Having high EQ can help you understand and respond to the emotions of
          others, whilst also helping you to become more accepting and confident
          in yourself. Change becomes easier, as you are aware of how you react
          to external forces and what those reactions mean. During times of
          stress, we often let our emotions get the better of us, so
          understanding why you are feeling a certain way stops you from making
          rash decisions. Emotional intelligence can also help once a decision
          has been made. It helps in accepting responsibility for mistakes and
          being able to let go of them. There are four levels of emotional
          intelligence:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Perceiving emotions</li>
          <li>Reasoning with emotions</li>
          <li>Understanding emotions</li>
          <li>Managing emotions</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)
          are very much two sides of the same coin, in that using both your EQ
          and IQ help you to deal with different situations. It is widely
          believed that your EQ is more important than your IQ and that we use
          our EQ more when dealing with problems. EQ has much more impact on the
          way that we act in our relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a long time IQ was given great importance, as there had been links
          made between higher IQ test scores and job performance and salary.
          However in recent years, there have been new studies that contradict
          the conclusions reached in the past. In these recent studies, higher
          levels of EQ have been linked to job performance whilst also being
          correlated with more fulfilling relationships with others. As more
          research is being done, the evidence suggests that EQ has greater and
          more wide ranging importance than IQ. This is not to say that IQ isn’t
          important at all, and having a balance of both is thought to be
          beneficial.

        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>There are three main reasons why EQ is important.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Self Awareness</strong>Being emotionally intelligent means
          that you have a great understanding of your own feelings. This
          includes why you are feeling certain emotions, how those emotions make
          you act, and how to deal with those emotions when they arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dealing with others</strong>Understanding your own emotions
          and their impact on you also helps you to understand other people’s
          emotions. This includes understanding why someone is acting or
          reacting in a certain way, internalising how you would react in the
          same situation, and ultimately empathising with them and how they are
          feeling, leading to greater compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dealing with situations</strong>Most people wish that they had
          better control of their emotions when they are in stressful
          situations. Being emotionally intelligent helps you to deal with the
          emotions you are feeling without letting them cause you to react in a
          way that you wouldn’t if your emotions weren’t heightened. Examples of
          when having high emotional intelligence helps you are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In times of great personal loss</li>
          <li>During interpersonal conflict</li>
          <li>When a mistake is made by you or someone else</li>
          <li>When a big decision needs to be made</li>
        </ul>
