        <h3>A simple problem I was blocked by</h3>
        <p>
          The problem was a very simple one, a typo. When completing the
          gradebook exercise, I typed ‘susan’ instead of ‘Susan’ in one line of
          my code. Since it was part of a larger chunk of code it was easy to
          miss.
          <br />I actually spent a lot of time Googling, thinking that there was
          something wrong with the syntax of my code. When I’d spent some time
          doing that, I decided to step away for some time and come back later
          with a fresh mind. This turned out to be exactly what I needed, as
          when I came back, I spotted the mistake right away. <br />The whole
          process was extremely frustrating. Firstly, because I was sure that I
          hadn’t made a mistake and the code should have been running properly
          and then secondly, because when I realised my mistake, it was so
          simple that I thought I should have spotted it right away or not even
          made it to begin with. <br />A big takeaway from the experience was
          that copy-pasting and using autofill can save a lot of time. Both from
          speed of typing and the fact that it’s impossible to make a typo when
          you’re not actually typing.

        <h3>A problem I solved elegantly</h3>
        <p>
          When completing the super fizzbuzz challenge I became stuck almost
          straight away. I understood what I needed to do, but I couldn’t see
          the solution in my head. The problem required you to write a function
          that took an array of numbers and called another function on every
          element in the array.
          <br />I used pseudocode to lay out exactly what I needed to write line
          by line. Firstly create a new array, then create a loop that goes
          through every element in the initial array and inside the loop,
          calling the original function and adding the returned value to the new
          array, and lastly return the new array. By laying it out like this,
          each step became very simple. <br />It felt good quickly using a
          problem solving technique that works right away. A lot of the other
          techniques I’ve used have still taken up some time and added to my
          frustration, but this made the problem easy to understand and easy to
          solve. <br />Solving this problem, I learnt the value of using
          pseudocode. It simplifies the task and gives you the steps you need to
          create a solution.

        <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Pseudocode<br />Pseudocode is something that I hadn’t used before this
          week and I didn’t really see the value in it at first. However, it
          didn’t take long for me to start using it regularly. I find it useful
          when writing functions. I use pseudocode to create a step-by-step
          guide for how the function is going to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying something <br />This is my go to approach when I feel like the
          problem isn’t too complex. Plug something in and see if it works. If
          it doesn’t, try something else. I usually repeat this until I’m out of
          ideas and I move on to another technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rubber ducky method<br />This isn’t a problem-solving technique I’ve
          used yet. I can see the benefit in explaining the code line-by-line to
          yourself and verbalising the expected outcome. I will make sure to try
          this when working on problems in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading error messages<br />I’ve made use of error messages to find
          the source of my problem while coding. Being able to pinpoint the
          specific point in my code that isn’t working as intended saves a lot
          of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Console.logging<br />I find this technique especially useful when I’m
          not sure where in the code the problem is. Adding a console.log
          wherever I think there could be a problem and checking each of the
          outputs works well for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Googling<br />This is by far my post used technique. There’s a very
          high chance that someone has had a very similar problem to the one I’m
          dealing with. There are plenty of forums filled with solved problems.
          Googling also helps to make sure the structure and syntax of my code
          is correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking your peers for help<br />Having talked to my peers during
          weekly catch ups and through the chats, I would feel confident to ask
          any questions I had about my code to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking coaches for help<br />The coaches have been a real help so far.
          I haven’t asked any questions directly so far, but their responses to
          other peoples questions has helped through a lot of the exercises. I
          feel confident in posing questions to the coaches, as I know I will
          get the right guidance to fix any problems I have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving your process with reflection<br />I’ve been finding
          reflecting on every bit of work I do very useful, not just when
          coding. I think it works because I am focusing on what I have learnt
          through the experience and how I can use this when moving forward.

        <h3>Relfection on asking for help</h3>
        <p>
          I was pretty reluctant to ask for help during the JavaScript kata
          exercises. I chose to use other problem-solving techniques (mainly
          Googling) to complete the work. However, sometimes this could be
          pretty time consuming and frustrating. Next time, I think I will use
          the same techniques, but also ask for help before I waste too much
          time.
