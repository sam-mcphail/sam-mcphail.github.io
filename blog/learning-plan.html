        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to get a job as a web developer or elsewhere in
          the industry. I hope that during my time at Dev Academy, I will form a
          greater idea of what I want to do specifically as a career.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of my strengths is problem solving. I am able to look at problems
          in different ways to form solutions. Being a problem solver was
          something that came up a lot when I was researching how to think like
          a programmer, so I think this will be helpful during the course.

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to see myself get better at time management over the
          course of the next few months. I think that being better at managing
          my time would be really helpful in all areas of my life. Being able to
          plan my time better would take a lot of stress off me in work life,
          but also my personal life as well.

          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to manage my workload, I will be dividing my work for the
          week up on a Monday, giving myself a clear overview of what work I
          have to get done each day. When I am working with others, I will
          create clear lines of communication at the beginning of the project,
          so that everyone is clear what they have to do. When things are
          building up and I am feeling stressed, I will reassess my plan for the
          week. In doing this I will have a greater idea of when I should be
          working on different things and it should take some of the pressure
          off me.

        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          When I am struggling I will use all available sources of help. To
          begin with I will make sure I have gone over all of the learning
          materials to make sure I haven’t missed anything. If I am still
          unsure, I will reach out to staff and other students in the hope that
          they will be able to show me the way. I am going to make sure that I
          don’t stay stuck on something without reaching out for too long so
          that my workflow is not disrupted.

        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect helpful guidance from the facilitator team throughout the
          course. I expect this to come in the form of showing me where I am
          going wrong and what direction to go in the future without explicitly
          giving me the solutions.
