        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to get a job as a web developer or elsewhere in
          the industry. I hope that during my time at Dev Academy, I will form a
          greater idea of what I want to do specifically as a career.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of my strengths is problem solving. I am able to look at problems
          in different ways to form solutions. Being a problem solver was
          something that came up a lot when I was researching how to think like
          a programmer, so I think this will be helpful during the course.

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to see myself get better at time management over the
          course of the next few months. I think that being better at managing
          my time would be really helpful in all areas of my life. Being able to
          plan my time better would take a lot of stress off me in work life,
          but also my personal life as well.

          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to manage my workload, I will be dividing my work for the
          week up on a Monday, giving myself a clear overview of what work I
          have to get done each day. When I am working with others, I will
          create clear lines of communication at the beginning of the project,
          so that everyone is clear what they have to do. When things are
          building up and I am feeling stressed, I will reassess my plan for the
          week. In doing this I will have a greater idea of when I should be
          working on different things and it should take some of the pressure
          off me.

          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          When I am struggling I will use all available sources of help. To
          begin with I will make sure I have gone over all of the learning
          materials to make sure I haven’t missed anything. If I am still
          unsure, I will reach out to staff and other students in the hope that
          they will be able to show me the way. I am going to make sure that I
          don’t stay stuck on something without reaching out for too long so
          that my workflow is not disrupted.

        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect helpful guidance from the facilitator team throughout the
          course. I expect this to come in the form of showing me where I am
          going wrong and what direction to go in the future without explicitly
          giving me the solutions.

      <div class="block-odd black-border">
        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I am still unsure exactly what kind of position I would like. I am
          sure that the skills I have learnt over the past five weeks and the
          skills I will learn in the coming weeks will be valuable during my
          career.

        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I definitely still think that one of my major strengths is my ability
          to problem solve. Through doing the challenges during foundations,
          this strength became apparent. A limitation would definitely be time
          management when it comes to bigger projects.

          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Speaking in front of people is often a weakness for me. Whenever I
          have had to do presentations in the past, there has always been a good
          amount of nerves that I have to get over. On top of this, another
          challenge could be time management on larger projects.

          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

        <p>
          I would say the same as I did in the foundations plan, but I would
          like to try my best to avoid using a fixed mindset in all parts of my
          life, but specifically in my learning.

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

          My expectations are the same as they were in the foundations learning
          plan.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-even black-border">
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          I expect myself to put my best foot forward throughout bootcamp. I
          think that the effort I put in over the next few months is really
          crucial and the effort will directly relate to what I get out of the
          course when it is over.

        <p>
          I will seek help through my peers and also through staff. I will try
          to not have a negative view towards asking for help that I had
          throughout foundations.

          facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My commitment is the same as it was in the foundations learning plan.
          It is relevant to bootcamp, as I will be working on my own and in
          groups.
