          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first thing I learnt is how valuable it can be when I reflect on
          things afterwards. During the first week, I found that the reflections
          got in the way a bit and I didn’t really see the use in them. However,
          as the weeks have gone on, I have realised that when I reflect on a
          topic, my understanding of what I did, what I learned and how I did it
          increases. Secondly, I learnt that in the past I have shown a fixed
          mindset when it comes to learning. There were times at university when
          I didn’t understand concepts or ideas straight away and this led to me
          thinking that I would not be able to learn it whether I tried or not.
          This meant that some of the work I completed wasn’t up to the standard
          it should have been. Lastly, I learnt that practicing mindfulness can
          really help with focus.

          What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Values are important in every part of life and are used in every
          decision you make. It’s no different when it comes to learning and
          programming. Values give you a reason to learn and they can help you
          out when you are stuck. Showing empathy comes into play when working
          with other people. Working in a group only works well when everyone is
          aware of how their actions are impacting others. Self-awareness is a
          lot like empathy in the fact that it comes into play when working with
          others. Being self-aware in a group basically comes down to being able
          to look at yourself from another person's perspective and see the
          impact of your actions.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          One big thing that surprised me about the core learning was just how
          much research has been put into every aspect of the human mind,
          learning and how they interact with each other. I think that this
          points to a change in the way scholars, educators and people in
          general are approaching learning. The two topics that come to mind
          when I think about this are neuroplasticity and growth mindset. The
          research into these two topics compliment each other and have led many
          people to the conclusion that just about anyone (especially young
          people) can learn just about anything using the right techniques and
          implementing the right mindset. Reading about this makes me believe
          that in the future there are going to be big changes in the way people
          learn at school, university and beyond.

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Definitely writing about myself. This is an aspect of core learning
          that I don’t think practice will help me get better at, or will take a
          lot of time at least. I think for the most part I am a private person
          when it comes to sharing my thoughts about myself or my emotions. It’s
          just something that makes me uncomfortable. However, I can see the
          value in doing the exercises that we have completed during the last
          five weeks. There is also the fact that putting yourself in
          uncomfortable positions can be good for learning and personal
          development, so the experience has been a positive one on the whole.

          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Employers aren’t just looking for people with coding experience.
          Sometimes programming experience isn’t even a requirement. The main
          thing they are looking for is a well-rounded person who can work well
          in a team and learn on the job. Every company will have a different
          set of tools they use to work. These can be learnt on the job.
          Something that is harder to learn is good core, human skills. The
          skills I have worked on over the last few weeks will not just make me
          a well-rounded programmer, but hopefully a more well-rounded person as
          well.

          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
          instead?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It hasn’t been a waste of time for me personally. A lot of this has
          been new for me, so learning about it made me think about a lot of
          things (learning particularly) in a very different way. I will
          definitely utilise the skills I have learnt.
