          My wellbeing plan using Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā model
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā model I am going to make a
          commitment to my physical, mental, spiritual and family well-being, as
          well as connecting more to nature.

        <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>
          Like everyone, I feel better physically and mentally when I am active.
          To benefit my physical health, I am going to make a commitment to
          workout at the gym for an hour and a half at least 4 times a week.
        </p>
        <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>
          I have been working from my parents house from time to time during
          foundations and plan to work there more often during bootcamp. To
          benefit my family wellbeing, I am going to make sure I am spending
          time with my parents whenever I am there.
        </p>
        <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>
          I find my emotional and mental wellbeing is at its best when I am
          spending as much time as possible with friends. To help with this I am
          going to make sure that I spend a good amount of time with my flat
          mates every day and organise at least one activity to do with my
          friends every week.
        </p>
        <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
        <p>
          I have recently started doing breathing exercises before I start
          working. As I am not a very spiritual person, this is the closest
          thing I have to a spiritual activity. Therefore, I am going to do a
          five minute breathing exercise at least once a day.
        </p>
        <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
        <p>
          With the weather warming up, I have started to spend more time
          outside. As the weeks go on and the weather gets better, I am going to
          spend at least half an hour a few times a week (weather permitting) to
          enjoy nature.
