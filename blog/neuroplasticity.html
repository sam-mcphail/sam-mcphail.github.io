        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Simply understanding that your brain is malleable is the first step to
          increasing brain function. This is because it immediately changes the
          way you think and approach learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many online and scholarly sources state that there are ten principles
          to neuroplasticity. These are:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Use it or lose it<br />
          Lack of practice over an extended period of time weakens neural
          pathways.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Use it and improve it<br />
          WIth a lot of practice over time, neural pathways strengthen.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Salience<br />
          If the practice you are doing is made meaningful/interesting/important
          to you, new skills and information are easier to hold on to.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Repetition<br />This is simple. The more a thought or action is
          repeated, the more it sticks.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Intensity<br />The effort put into learning has a great impact on
          the quality of the learning. This includes increasing intensity over
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Specificity<br />Training or learning should be specific to what
          your intended outcome is.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Age<br />The younger a person is, the more malleable their brain
          is. In other words, it is easier to learn when you are younger.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Time<br />There are ‘windows of opportunity’ when your brain is
          more receptive to learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Transference<br />Learning in one area that strengthens certain
          neural pathways can activate nearby neural pathways. This means the
          training of one skill can transfer to another skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Interference<br />Your brain can learn bad habits as easily as it
          can learn good habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows that there are many factors that cause changes in your
          brain. Being aware of what they are and how they might interact with
          each other is important when wanting to increase brain function.
        </p>
        <p>
          By grouping some of these principles together, you can benefit your
          learning greatly. Use it or lose it, use it and improve it, repetition
          and time can be grouped together to create a learning plan. Use it or
          lose it and use it and improve it are two sides of the same coin, and
          fit in nicely with repetition. Practice, practice, practice and pick a
          specific time when your brain is open to learning. Then you can look
          at some other principles individually. Make sure there is intensity
          and specificity to your learning to engage the neural pathways in your
          brain and make sure it is meaningful to you for salience. While you
          are learning, stay on task to avoid interference. The transference
          aspect of neuroplasticity comes naturally, as you will find similar
          tasks will become easier. The final principle is age. Although it may
          seem like this principle suggests you may be too old to learn
          something new, the takeaway from it should be that the earlier you
          learn something the better. Start today and not tomorrow. Following a
          plan like this and putting in some work will help greatly in
          increasing neuroplasticity.
        </p>

          These resources were helpful in understanding the principles of
          neuroplasticity. Although some ideas were specific to therapy, they
          can be used to help understand neuroplasticity in a more general
          sense.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          The growth mindset can best be described with one word, ‘yet’. A major
          thing holding a lot of people back from long-term learning goals is a
          negative view towards not knowing something. The growth mindset is the
          idea that you shouldn’t say to yourself or others that you don’t know
          something or that you’ve failed something. You should instead say that
          you haven’t learnt it yet or you haven’t passed it yet. To elaborate
          further, people with a growth mindset believe that just because you
          don’t have a certain skill, it doesn’t mean that you can’t learn it. A
          growth mindset isn’t something that you are born with. It can be
          learnt and utilised by anyone. The opposite of the growth mindset is
          the fixed mindset. As the name suggests, people with a fixed mindset
          believe that skills, intelligence and the ability to learn are fixed
          in a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some key differences between the two are the way they deal with facing
          challenges, putting in effort and receiving criticism. People with a
          growth mindset face challenges head on and see the positives in them.
          They see the value in putting in effort and often learn to enjoy it
          even if it is something they usually wouldn’t choose to do. Finally,
          they see criticism as something to learn from. On the other hand,
          people with a fixed mindset try to avoid challenges whenever possible.
          They may not see the value in putting in effort, as they believe it
          won’t change the way things are. Finally, they ignore criticism or try
          to avoid it entirely and don’t see the positives they could take from
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through exploring the two opposing mindsets, I realised that at times
          I have displayed a fixed mindset towards certain things and it has
          probably held me back. I can think of a number of times at school and
          university that I didn’t try my hardest when working on a project
          because I didn’t think I would be capable of learning everything I had
          to or producing the perfect end product. On the other hand, I can also
          think of times when I showed a growth mindset, put my mind to learning
          something and I succeeded in my goals. This shows that while I am
          capable of utilising a growth mindset, I can just as easily fall into
          the trap of being stuck in a fixed mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I will find it fairly easy to incorporate a growth mindset
          into my learning journey. Firstly, signing up for Dev Academy and
          showing the desire to learn is already an example of the mindset.
          Moving forward I am going to keep myself from being too worried about
          not understanding concepts, remembering details or getting things
          correct immediately. Not being able to understand a concept in web
          development is extremely common for beginners and as I move forward I
          know that I will find these concepts more and more manageable.

        <h3>My Learning Plan and Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          The concepts of neuroplasticity and the growth mindset will blend well
          into my learning plan and how I strategise in the future. In my
          learning plan I wrote that I want to get better at time management.
          This is something that I have struggled with for a long time and even
          in the last few weeks, I haven’t completely gotten on top of it. Even
          though I haven’t learnt to manage my time as well as I would like to,
          using the growth mindset I know that in the future I am more than
          capable of doing so. I mentioned in the neuroplasticity section how
          someone could benefit their learning using the principles of
          neuroplasticity. A specific principle that I am going to incorporate
          into my strategies is repetition. Repeating some of the concepts,
          ideas and skills that I find difficult now will help them come a lot
          easier as time goes on.
