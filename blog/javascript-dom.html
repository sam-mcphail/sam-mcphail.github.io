        <h3>JavaScript’s Relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          While HTML displays text and images on a website and CSS formats and
          styles the page’s contents, there is a lot more happening behind the
          scenes when you visit a web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vast majority of modern websites have some degree of interactivity
          to them. This is where JavaScript comes in. JavaScript gives web
          developers the ability to manipulate the HTML and CSS that form the
          website, based on the actions of the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Code written in JS has the ability to monitor keystrokes, mouse clicks
          and other inputs from the user to change the appearance of the page.
          An example of this is in the DOM interactions exercise we completed.
          This image shows how three different mouse interactions caused three
          different CSS style changes to the page.

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is different to HTML and CSS in that code doesn’t just have
          to be executed from top to bottom. A crucial feature is the ability to
          control the flow of the execution and even the ability to repeat it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The if condition lets us only execute code when certain conditions are
          met. This can be paired with the else condition, which executes the
          code when those same conditions aren’t met. These can be used in
          sequence to create a chain of if … else if … else statements that
          execute different code based on many different conditions. A real life
          process that can be seen as an if … else statement is something as
          simple as if you are thirsty, drink water, else don’t drink water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being able to loop through code is crucial. We are able to run through
          the same chunk of code as many times as we want. We do this by
          initialising a variable (usually ‘i’). This is given a starting value
          (usually 0) and increased by some amount (usually 1) every time the
          chunk of code is executed until it reaches a limit that is set. In
          real life, a loop that your brain works through would be in a
          situation where you are hungry and there is a bowl of fruit in front
          of you. You would execute the code (eat a piece of fruit), then check
          whether the condition to loop again (still hungry) is met, and loop
          again until the condition to loop is not met anymore (full of fruit).
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of an if … else statement and a loop in action is in our
          JavaScript Cafe exercise. We can see that the for loop is set to loop
          until ‘i’ has increased to the same length as the customer order.
          After that, our loop is finished and the next piece of code in the
          function executes. Inside of this loop is an if … else statement. This
          statement sets the condition that if the product has stock above 0,
          reduce the stock by 1 and add the price of the item to the total sale
          price, but if the stock is not above 0 (else), the next bit of code
          executes, sending an alert that we are out of the product.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model and without it, we wouldn’t be
          able to use JavaScript to interact with our HTML and CSS. To
          understand it, we should run through each word in the name. The
          document basically just means the webpage we are working with. The
          object means any one thing or group of things that is a part of the
          document that we can manipulate. The model means how it is all
          structured, how everything fits together. The DOM is often represented
          as a tree showing the structure of the objects within the model.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/DOM-tree.png" width="300" alt />
        <figcaption>The DOM tree</figcaption>
        <p>
          An example of interacting with the DOM is in our DOM Interactions
          exercise. We accessed the three elements by their class names ‘blue’,
          ‘green’ and ‘invisible’. Here we changed the values of our three
          totals by calling the document.getElementsByClassName() method which
          does exactly what it says in the name. The document part of this is
          letting us access the document object. This line of JS looks at the
          length of each of the classes (how many elements have that class name)
          and adds that to the total.

        <h3>Accessing Data From Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays and objects are both structures in which we can store data.
          They both have their uses, but they differ in the way we access the
          data inside them.
        </p>
        <p>
          An array is basically a list of items with their own index inside of a
          variable. We could have an array of cities like cities = [‘Auckland’,
          ‘Christchurch’, ‘Wellington’]. We would then access them using their
          index. Their index is their place in their numerical place in the
          array. This starts at 0 though and not 1. For example, we would access
          Auckland in this array using cities[0].
        </p>
        <p>
          An object is different because the items in the object reference
          different things. For example, in the JavaScript Cafe exercise we used
          an object for our different products. Inside of the objects we were
          able to set the stock and the price.
        </p>

        <h3>What are Functions?</h3>
        <p>
          A function is basically a piece of code that can be called on and
          executed whenever needed. This code, when executed, performs a task.
          This could range from one line of code, returning the value of a
          variable, to thousands of lines of code, performing tasks far more
          complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          To define a function, you write the keyword ‘function’, the name of
          the function, open and closed brackets which may include the names of
          the parameters the function requires, and curly brackets that hold the
          code that is to be executed when the function is called.
        </p>
        <p>
          To call a function, you write the name of the function followed by
          open and closed brackets which include the actual parameters you want
          to use if the function requires them.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of a function in action is this function that provides a
          random integer within a given range that we used in the JavaScript
          Cafe exercise.
