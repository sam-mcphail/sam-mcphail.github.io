        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think that in a way an ethical decision I made was to apply for Dev
          Academy. Having finished university at the end of last year, I wasn’t
          sure what I wanted to do with myself. I started working in warehousing
          after I left uni, but I felt that I needed to push myself and try
          something that really interested me. When the opportunity arose to
          apply for Dev Academy I thought it was the right thing to do for me. I
          felt like I owed it to myself to go for it and give it my best shot. I
          value self respect and what comes with that is putting myself in
          positions where I get the best out of myself and positions that will
          be beneficial for me in the long run.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My culture and the people around me have caused me to value working
          with others highly. Socialising and spending time with the people I am
          close with is important to me and a big part of who I am. In the
          relationships I have, I value mutual respect. When working with new
          people I put effort into earning respect, but also begin the
          relationship by showing respect.

        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p>
          A key strength of mine is problem solving. Throughout my life and in
          my studies especially, I have found that when a solution to a problem
          is not immediately clear, I am able to figure out a way to solve it.
          Another strength is my ability to always complete the task at hand.
          Whether working on a small task or a large scale project, I always
          make sure it gets finished and is done to a high standard.
        </p>

      <div class="block-even black-border">
        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          When I am working, I have a tendency to procrastinate and mismanage my
          time. This often leads to needing to complete the majority of a task
          right at the end. Although I always complete my work to a standard I
          am happy with, it can cause a lot of stress when I don’t manage my
          time properly. I find that when working with others this is not as
          much of a problem because I have people relying on me, so I will have
          to focus on this when I am doing solo work.

        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h3>
        <p>
          During my time at university, I worked on many group projects. For the
          most part everyone would pull their weight and the team would be able
          to produce high quality work. There were a couple of instances where I
          worked in groups with one or more people who didn’t share the same
          drive to complete the task as the rest of the group. In one of these
          instances we had one member who only started communicating with the
          rest of us right before the due date. This caused a lot of stress for
          the group as we assumed their work would have been almost completed by
          this time, but they hadn’t even started it. This meant that the whole
          group had to pull together to complete this person's tasks. Looking
          back on this experience, I think that we probably all could have done
          more to communicate effectively as a team. I have learned that it is
          easier for everyone to rely on each other when there is good
          communication.
